{{ authorName }}, in case you were still interested in participating in our project 'biofactoid.org', just wanted to extend the invitation one last time. Sorry for the inconvenience!

> Hi {{ authorName }}, I'm {{ emailSenderName }}, a researcher at U. Toronto and our group (Harvard/OHSU) just launched our project 'Biofactoid' which tries to expand and improve how published results are communicated, discovered and used by researchers. I wanted to know if you would try it by adding one of your articles on {{ appDomain }}.
>
> Biofactoid lets you create a digital profile of experimentally-confirmed interactions in your report, like 'Ras phosphorylates Raf' or 'Ras binds GTP'. This information makes it easier to find your article (i.e. via genes/interactions added) and connect to other research (e.g. papers with same genes/interactions). To get this information out to researchers, we present each profile as an interactive graphical abstract on {{ appDomain }}, post them on Twitter and distribute the data freely to research organizations/tools so they can offer it to their users.
>
> {{ appDomain }} is super simple to use so you can add an article in minutes. I thought your report involving {{ intParticipantSrc }} and {{ intParticipantTgt }} ({{ articleCitation }}) would be a good fit!
>
> Thanks in advance and don't hesitate to ask me any questions.
