Hi {{ authorName }}, I'm {{ emailSenderName }}, a researcher at U. Toronto and our group (Harvard/OHSU) just launched our project 'Biofactoid' which tries to expand and improve how published results are communicated, discovered and used by researchers. I wanted to know if you would try it by adding one of your articles on {{ appDomain }}. It only takes about 3-5 minutes.

Biofactoid lets you create a digital profile of experimentally-confirmed interactions in your report, like 'Ras phosphorylates Raf' or 'Ras binds GTP'. This information makes it easier to find your article (i.e. via genes/interactions added) and connect to other research (e.g. papers with same genes/interactions). To get this information out to researchers, we present each profile as an interactive graphical abstract on {{ appDomain }}, post them on Twitter (@biofactoid) and distribute the data freely to research organizations/tools so they can offer it to their users.

{{ appDomain }} is super simple to use. I thought your report involving {{ intParticipantSrc }} and {{ intParticipantTgt }} ({{ articleCitation }}) would be a good fit!

Thanks in advance.

Jeff
