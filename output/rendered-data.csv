Adding a profile to Biofactoid is like creating a pin on Google Maps: Details you add make your research easier for scientists to discover (e.g search engine), explore (e.g. visualization software) and link to useful knowledge, like papers and gene databases.

All it takes is for you to draw the molecular-level interactions backed by experiments (e.g. ‘RAS phosphorylates RAF’). Biofactoid stores this data, attributes it to your paper and shares it with scientists, all for free.

Check out biofactoid.org to see recent articles. Happy exploring!

Jeff
