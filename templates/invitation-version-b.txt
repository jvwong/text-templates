In minutes, create a structured abstract of your published research with Factoid for free.

Factoid (https://factoid.baderlab.org/) is a website that assists authors in creating a computer-readable record of biochemical pathways present in their paper. Verified records are attributed to authors and made freely available to the scientific community.

Molecular Cell is collaborating with Factoid, an academic project developed in the labs of Gary Bader (University of Toronto), Chris Sander (Dana-Farber and Harvard Medical School), and Emek Demir (Oregon Health & Science University). The editors of Molecular Cell are now inviting scientists to participate as external users. Participation is entirely voluntary.

To use it, just follow these steps:
  1. Launch Factoid in your browser using the link below
  2. Describe genes, chemicals, and their interactions
  3. Submit when done

To begin, follow this link for "{{ title }}" by {{ firstAuthorName }} et al. at Molecular Cell (PubMed identifier: {{ trackingId }}):
{{ docUrl }}

You’re welcome to reach out to me, Jeffrey Wong the outreach manager or to the Molecular Cell editorial team (cc’d), with any questions or concerns you might have.

Best,

Gary Bader, Emek Demir and Chris Sander
