Dear Dr. {{ contributorLastName }},

Congratulations on the acceptance of "{{ title }}" by {{ firstAuthorName }} et al. at Molecular Cell (PubMed identifier: {{ trackingId }}).

Recently, Molecular Cell has begun a collaboration with Factoid (https://factoid.baderlab.org/), an academic project developed in the labs of Gary Bader (University of Toronto), Chris Sander (Dana-Farber and Harvard Medical School), and Emek Demir (Oregon Health & Science University). Factoid is a website that generates a computer-readable record of biochemical pathways present in published papers. This record is curated by the papers' authors, providing verification of its scientific accuracy. Verified records are attributed to authors and saved in Factoid, where they can be freely used by other members of the scientific community. Our goal is to develop a system that supports improved accessibility and attribution of scientific knowledge.

The Molecular Cell editors have evaluated Factoid, and we are now inviting scientists to participate as external users. Your paper was identified as an excellent fit for Factoid. On behalf of our Factoid-Molecular Cell collaboration, I would like to invite you to use the Factoid website to digitally capture the biological interactions described in your Molecular Cell paper. We anticipate that this should take no more than 20 minutes. Participation is entirely voluntary, but we would very much value your experience and knowledge.

To get started:
  1. Launch Factoid in your browser using the link below
  2. Describe genes, chemicals, and their interactions
  3. Submit when done

That's it - we will take care of the rest!  After we’re finished, we’ll contact you to hear about your experience; we’d appreciate your feedback about how we can improve. It would be greatly appreciated if you could submit by {{ submitByDate }}.


To begin, follow this link:

Thank you in advance for your consideration. You’re welcome to reach out to me, Jeffrey Wong the outreach manager or to the Molecular Cell editorial team (cc’d), with any questions or concerns you might have.

Best,

Gary Bader, Emek Demir and Chris Sander
